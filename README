TODO

3/26/2020
refactor, make it look pretty, kinda hard to read at the moment
  add to classes, make it work
update wait until next day, make work for weekends - DONE
add logging for timestamp of every buy and sell of stock. log to excel file

add in some volume calculations?
  if price is increasing but volume isnt, could signal the end of a trend

should i actually require at least 1M in volume?
  could probably lower to like 500k or something, just unsure. will have to do more testing

... maybe if no stocks are found wait an hour and try again...

logging system, have it email me a report at the end of every trading day with all trades attached...
